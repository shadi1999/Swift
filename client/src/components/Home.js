                SiwftCourse, a web application that uses the BitTorrent protocol and other features that make
                it cost less bandwidth.
                The system will take advantage of the studentsâ€™ upload bandwidth to support the stream.
                To solve the timing of classes problem, the lecture will be recorded so students can still
                watch it after it ends for a period of 24 hours. Furthermore,
                there will be no need for a mobile app because the website will be responsive
                (supports all screen sizes).
